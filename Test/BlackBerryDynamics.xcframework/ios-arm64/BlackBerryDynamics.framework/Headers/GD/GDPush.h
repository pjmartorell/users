 * 
 *
 * This API is part of the BlackBerry Dynamics Push Channel feature.
 * For an overall description of how to use the feature, see under
 * \reflink GDPushChannel GDPushChannel \endlink.
 *
 * The Push Connection is the container and conduit for the device's Push
 * Channels. An application may open multiple Push Channels; all will be
 * managed within a single Push Connection.
 *
 * The Push Connection is automatically established during BlackBerry Dynamics
 * authorization processing, and then maintained by the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * Runtime under application control.
 * The application can instruct the runtime to switch the Push Connection
 * off and on.
 *
 * When instructed to switch off, the BlackBerry Dynamics Runtime will terminate the Push
 * Connection, and suspend its maintenance. When instructed to switch
 * back on, the BlackBerry Dynamics Runtime will re-establish the Push Connection, and
 * resume maintenance.
 *
 * Switching off the Push Connection might be an option that the application
 * offers to the end user, for example, allowing them to
 * reduce power consumption on the device.
 *
 * Push Connection functions cannot be called until BlackBerry Dynamics
 * authorization processing is complete.
 * @see \reflink GDPushChannel GDPushChannel \endlink
 * @see \reflink GDiOS \endlink, for BlackBerry Dynamics authorization
 * @see \ref threads
 * @see \ref background_execution
 *
 * <h3>Push Channel Network</h3>
 * The Push Connection is a link between the mobile application and the BlackBerry
 * Dynamics proxy infrastructure Network Operation Center (NOC).
 * The Push Channel is a link between the mobile application and its application
 * server (App Server). There can be more than one Push Channel; the mobile
 * application can receive push communications from more than one App Server.
 * Push Channels are mediated by the NOC, and sometimes other proxy
 * infrastructure elements.
 *
 * This is shown in the following diagram.
 * \image html "Push Channel network.png"
 *
 * <h3>API Overview</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics Push Connection API consists of a small number of functions that must
 * be used in a particular order. Whilst some other APIs are general-purpose
 * toolkits, the Push Connection API has only a single purpose: to enable
 * the Push Channel API.
 *
 * The normal sequence of operations is as follows.
 * -# Application started.
 * -# BlackBerry Dynamics initialization and authorization, see under \reflink GDiOS \endlink.
 * -# When the application needs a Push Channel...
 * -# Call
 * \reflink GDPushConnection::sharedConnection sharedConnection \endlink 
 * to access the Push Connection object,
 * -# Call \reflink GDPushConnection::isConnected isConnected \endlink to check the connection state,
 * -# If the state is not connected:
 *   -# Set a \reflink GDPushConnectionDelegate GDPushConnectionDelegate \endlink to handle connection state changes
 *   -# Call \reflink GDPushConnection::connect connect \endlink to ensure that connection is
 *      being attempted,
 *   -# When the \reflink GDPushConnectionDelegate::onStatus: onStatus \endlink callback in the
 *      handler is invoked, go back and check the connection state again.
 * -# If the state is connected, proceed to setting up a Push Channel.
 * .
 * For details of Push Channel set-up, see under \reflink GDPushChannel GDPushChannel \endlink.
 *
 * <h2>Code Snippets</h2> The following code snippets illustrate some common tasks.
 * <h3>Terminate Push Connection</h3>
 * \code
 * [[GDPushConnection sharedConnection] disconnect];
 * \endcode
 * After the disconnect, the connection can be re-opened later.
 *
 * <h3>Re-open Push Connection</h3>
 * \code
 * if ( ! [[GDPushConnection sharedConnection] isConnected] ) {
 *     myHandler = [[AppHandler alloc] init];
 *     myConnection.delegate = myHandler;
 *     [myConnection connect];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a check for whether the Push Channel service is
 * already available. If it is not, then a connection is initiated.
 * The connection attempt is asynchronous. The <tt>onStatus</tt>

 * - Connect to the application server to retrieve the data. (Connection
 * could use a socket, an HTTP
 * request, or another means of communication. From the Push Channel
 * point of view, this is an out-of-band communication.)
 *
 * <h3>Handle Channel Closure</h3>
 * \code
 * -(void)onChannelClose:(NSString*)data
 * {
 *     NSLog(@"onChannelClose: %@", data);
 *     myApp.pushIsOpen = NO;
 *     [myApp discardPushToken:data];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a simple <tt>onChannelClose</tt> handler. The
 * following takes place when the Push Channel is closed:
 * - The token is logged to the system monitor
 * - The application's channel state is flagged as not connected
 * - The application <tt>discardPushToken</tt> function is called. The
 * token of the closed channel is passed as a parameter.
 *
 * The <tt>discardPushToken</tt> function would delete the application's
 * copy of the token, possibly after checking that it matches the
 * <tt>whichWas</tt> parameter.
 * The function could also initiate connection of a new Push Channel, which
 * would have a new token. See \reflink GDPushChannel::connect connect \endlink.
 *
 * <h3>Handle Channel Error</h3>
 * \code
 * -(void)onChannelError:(int)error
 * {
 *     NSLog(@"onChannelError: %d", error);
 *     myApp.pushIsOpen = NO;
 *     myApp.pushErr = error;
 *     [myApp discardPushToken];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a simple <tt>onChannelError</tt> handler.
 *
 * The handler logs the error code to the system monitor, flags
 * the channel's state as not connected, records the error code in
 * the application, then calls the application <tt>discardPushToken</tt>
 * function.
 *
 * The <tt>discardPushToken</tt> function could do any of the following:
 * - Delete the application's copy of the token.
 * - Set the error state in an ongoing status display.
 * - Depending on the error code, initiate connection of a new
 * Push Channel, which would have a new token. See \reflink GDPushChannel::connect connect \endlink.
 *
 * <h3>Handle Ping Failure</h3>
 * See under \reflink GDPushChannelDelegate::onChannelPingFail: onChannelPingFail \endlink
 * for an explanation of the Ping Failure feature.

 * \code
 * -(void)onChannelPingFail:(int)error
 * {
 *     NSLog(@"onChannelPingFail %d", error);
 *     if ( error == 605 ) {
 *         [myApp resendPushToken];
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a simple <tt>onChannelPingFail</tt> handler.
 *
 * The handler logs the error code to the system monitor,
 * then calls the application <tt>resendPushToken</tt> function if the
 * token was lost.
 *
 * The <tt>resendPushToken</tt> function, which would be written by the
 * application developer, would send the application's stored token to the
 * application server. This could use a socket, an HTTP
 * request, or another means of communication. From the Push Channel
 * point of view, this is an out-of-band communication.
 *
 * The <tt>resendPushToken</tt> function should expect that the server is
 * not immediately available, perhaps employing a retry policy.

/** Manage Push Channel tokens and notifications.
 * 
 * The Push Channel framework is a BlackBerry Dynamics feature used to
 * receive notifications from an application server.
 *
 * Note that the BlackBerry Dynamics Push Channel feature is not part of the
 * native iOS notification feature set.
 *
 * Use of the Push Channel feature in the application is dependent on:
 * - Completion of BlackBerry Dynamics authorization processing.
 * - Connection to the BlackBerry Dynamics infrastructure.
 * .
 *
 * Push Channel data communication doesn't go via the proxy specified in the
 * native settings of the device or computer on which the application is
 * running, if any.
 *
 * @see <a  HREF="https://docs.blackberry.com/en/endpoint-management/blackberry-uem/"  target="_blank" >Manuals page for the BlackBerry Dynamics enterprise servers</a > for the Platform Overview.
 * @see \ref threads
 * @see \ref background_execution
 * @see <a
 *     HREF="https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/NetworkingInternet/Conceptual/RemoteNotificationsPG/"
 *     target="_blank"
 * >Local and Remote Notification Programming Guide</a> on the apple.com
 * developer website.
 *
 * <h2>Push Channel Usage</h2>
 * Push Channels are established by the BlackBerry Dynamics application, then
 * used by the application server when needed. The sequence of events is as
 * follows.
 * -# The application sets an event handler for Push Channel notifications.
 * -# The application requests a Push Channel token from the BlackBerry Dynamics
 *    proxy infrastructure.
 * -# The application sends the token to its server using, for example, a socket
 *    connection or HTTP request.
 * -# The application can now wait for a Push Channel notification.\n\n
 * Later, when the server has data for the user, the following steps take
 * place:\n\n
 * -# The server sends a Push Channel notification message through the
 *    BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure. The message is addressed using
 *    the token.
 * -# The message is sent on, and the waiting application's event handler is
 *    invoked.\n\n
 * Later, when the server has more data for the user, the following steps
 * take place:\n\n
 * -# The server sends another Push Channel notification message through the
 *    proxy infrastructure. The message is addressed using the same token.
 * -# The message is sent on, and the waiting application's event handler is
 *    invoked again.
 * .
 * \image html "sq01 Push Channel.png" "Push Channel sequence diagram"\image rtf "sq01 Push Channel.png" "Push Channel sequence diagram"
 *
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics platform keeps data communications between the
 * application and server alive while the application is waiting for a Push
 * Channel notification. This is achieved by sending "heartbeat" messages at an
 * interval that is dynamically optimized for battery and network performance.
 *
 * <h2>Ping Failure</h2>
 * Ping Failure is an optional feature of the Push Channel framework. The
 * application server can register a ping address after receiving the Push
 * Channel token from the mobile application.
 *
 * If the application server registers a ping address, then it will be
 * periodically checked ("pinged") by the BlackBerry Dynamics Network Operation
 * Center (NOC). If the server does not respond to a ping, then the NOC notifies
 * the application that requested the corresponding Push Channel.
 * 
 * The purpose of this feature is to support servers that lose the Push Channel
 * token when they are restarted.
 *
 * See the \ref GNP for details of Ping Failure registration.
 * 
 * <h2>Programming Interface</h2>
 * The Push Channel programming interface is asynchronous and state-based. The
 * application code creates a Push Channel object for each channel it will use,
 * typically one per application server. When a channel changes state, or a
 * channel event occurs, the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime notifies the
 * application.
 * 
 * <h3>Notifications</h3>
 * To notify the application, the runtime posts an <tt>NSNotification</tt>.
 *
 * For all <tt>NSNotification</tt> instances that are Push Channel
 * notifications:
 * - The object will be the Push Channel object for the channel to which the
 *   notification relates.
 * - The name depends on the type of event or change that has occurred. It will
 *   be one of the following values.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelOpenedNotification GDPushChannelOpenedNotification \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelMessageNotification GDPushChannelMessageNotification \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelClosedNotification GDPushChannelClosedNotification \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelErrorNotification GDPushChannelErrorNotification \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelPingFailedNotification GDPushChannelPingFailedNotification \endlink.
 *   .
 * - The contents of the user information dictionary, <tt>userInfo</tt>, depends
 *   on the event type. The following values are used as keys.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelTokenKey GDPushChannelTokenKey \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelHostKey GDPushChannelHostKey \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelMessageKey GDPushChannelMessageKey \endlink.
 *   - \reflink GDPushChannel::GDPushChannelErrorKey GDPushChannelErrorKey \endlink.
 *   .
 * .
 * Push Channel state changes can also be detected by key-value observing (KVO)
 * of the \reflink GDPushChannel::state state \endlink property.
 *

 * and what actions take place, are detailed below, and summarized in the
 * following table. The table also summarizes which notifications are expected
 * in each state.
 * <table>
 *     <tr>
 *          <th>State</th>
 *          <th class="th50percent">Functions and actions</th>

 * </table>


 * The transitions in the above table are also shown in this diagram.
 * \image html "st01 Push Channel.png" "Push Channel state transition diagram"\image rtf "st01 Push Channel.png" "Push Channel state transition diagram"
 * 
 * Note that an individual Push Channel might or might not
 * be closed when the overall Push Channel service becomes unavailable.
 *
 * @see \ref GNP
 * 
 * <h3>Notification feature differences</h3>
 * The capabilities of the BlackBerry Dynamics Push Channel are different to the
 * capabilities of the native Apple Push Notification Service (APNS) in the
 * following ways.
 *
 * Only native notifications can be received when the application is in
 * background. This might change in a future release of iOS.
 *
 * In principle, native notifications alert the user, not the application.
 * Having been alerted, the user may choose to open the application. BlackBerry
 * Dynamics Push Channel messages alert the application, which in turn may alert
 * the user.
 *
 * BlackBerry Dynamics Push Channel messages can include a "payload" of
 * application data from the server. The application data is conveyed by the
 * proxy infrastructure from the server to the application.
 * 
 * Native notifications may be received whenever the device has a connection to
 * APNS. BlackBerry Dynamics Push Channel messages may be received whenever the
 * application has a connection to the BlackBerry Dynamics infrastructure.
 *
 * <h2>Push Channel Identifiers</h2>
 * Every Push Channel must have an identifier. Identifiers must be unique within
 * an application. A Push Channel identifier is a text string set by the
 * application code. Note that Push Channel identifiers aren't the same as Push
 * Channel tokens. Token values are set by the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * infrastructure and runtime.
 *
 * The following convention represents best practice for Push Channel
 * identifiers.
 *
 * A Push Channel identifier should be composed of a <em>domain</em> followed by
 * a module <em>name</em> and an optional <em>purpose</em>. The parts are
 * separated by full stops (periods). The following examples illustrate the
 * convention.
 *
 * Example: <tt>com.example.mobile-life.email</tt>
 * - Domain is "com.example"
 * - Name is "mobile-life"
 * - Purpose is "email"
 * .
 *
 * Example: <tt>com.example.dashboard</tt>
 * - Domain is "com.example"
 * - Name is "dashboard"
 * - Purpose is omitted.
 * .
 *
 * The rules for identifier part values are as follows.
 * - Domain must be the reversal of an Internet domain that is owned by the
 *   developer organisation.
 * - Name must be unique within all the organisation's applications, libraries,
 *   and other code modules that might create a Push Channel. Ensuring
 *   uniqueness of name values is the responsibility of the developer
 *   organisation.
 * - Purpose need only be used in the case that a single application, library,
 *   or other code module uses more than one Push Channel. Ensuring uniqueness
 *   of purpose values is the responsibility of the code module's developer.
 * .
 *
 * <h2>Code Snippets</h2> The following code snippets illustrate some common tasks.
 * <h3>Open Push Channel</h3>
 * The following snippet shows a Push Channel being created and opened after
 * checking that the service is available.
 * \code
 * if ([GDReachability sharedInstance].isPushChannelAvailable) {
 *     NSLog( @"Push Channel service available");
 *     myChannel = [[GDPushChannel alloc] initWithIdentifier:@"com.example.dashboard"];
 *     myHandler = [[AppChannelHandler alloc] init]
 *     NSNotificationCenter *notificationCenter = [NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter];
 *     [notificationCenter addObserver:myHandler
 *                            selector:@selector(channelOpenedNotification:)
 *                                name:GDPushChannelOpenedNotification
 *                              object:myChannel];
 *
 *     [notificationCenter addObserver:myHandler
 *                            selector:@selector(channelClosedNotification:)
 *                                name:GDPushChannelClosedNotification
 *                              object:myChannel];
 *
 *     [notificationCenter addObserver:myHandler
 *                            selector:@selector(channelErrorNotification:)
 *                                name:GDPushChannelErrorNotification
 *                              object:myChannel];
 *
 *     [notificationCenter addObserver:myHandler
 *                            selector:@selector(channelPingFailedNotification:)
 *                                name:GDPushChannelPingFailedNotification
 *                              object:myChannel];
 *
 *     [notificationCenter addObserver:myHandler
 *                            selector:@selector(channelMessageReceivedNotification:)
 *                                name:GDPushChannelMessageNotification
 *                              object:myChannel];
 *     [myChannel connect];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows the following taking place:
 * - Availability logged to the system monitor.
 * - Allocation of a Push Channel object.
 * - Allocation of an application Push Channel event handler.
 * - Registration of the new handler for all notifications from the channel.
 *   All notifications are sent to the same handler instance, but to different
 *   functions, specified as selectors.
 * - Attempt to connect the Push Channel.
 * .
 * 
 * The attempt is asynchronous. The associated
 * <tt>GDPushChannelOpenedNotification</tt>
 * notification would be received if and when the attempt is succesful (not
 * shown).
 *
 * <h3>Close Push Channel</h3>
 * \code
 * [myChannel disconnect];
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows: Request to disconnect the Push Channel.
 * 
 * The request is asynchronous. The associated
 * <tt>GDPushChannelClosedNotification</tt>
 * notification would be received when the closure is finalized (not shown).
 *
 * <h2>Code Snippets</h2> The following code snippets illustrate some common tasks.
 * <h3>Handle Push Channel Opening</h3>
 * The following snippet shows a simple handler for when a Push Channel opens.
 * \code
 * -(void)channelOpenedNotification:(NSNotification *)notification
 * {
 *     NSString *token = notification.userInfo[GDPushChannelTokenKey];
 *     NSLog(@"GDPushChannelOpenedNotification token: %@", token);
 *     NSString *host = notification.userInfo[GDPushChannelHostKey];
 *     if (host != nil) {
 *         NSLog(@"GDPushChannelOpenedNotification push channel host: %@", host);
 *         myApp.pushChannelHost = host;
 *     }
 *     myApp.pushIsOpen = YES;
 *     myApp.pushToken = token;
 *     [myApp sendPushToken];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows the following taking place:
 * - The Push Channel token is extracted from the user information dictionary in
 *   the notification.
 * - The token is logged to the system monitor.
 * - The application flags internally that its channel is open, and stores the
 *   token value.
 * - The <tt>sendPushToken</tt> function in the application is called.
 * .
 *
 * The <tt>sendPushToken</tt> function, which would be written by the
 * application developer, would send the token to the application server. This
 * could use a socket, an HTTP request, or another means of communication. From
 * the Push Channel point of view, this is an out-of-band communication.
 *
 * The server will use the token to address Push Channel notification messages
 * back to the application. These would be received by the application's
 * Push Channel event handler code.
 *
 * <h3>Receive Push Channel Message</h3>
 * \code
 * - (void)channelMessageReceivedNotification:(NSNotification *)notification
 * {
 *     NSString *data = notification.userInfo[GDPushChannelMessageKey];
 *     NSLog(@"channelMessageReceivedNotification message: %@", data);
 *     [myApp processPush:data];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows the following taking place when a Push Channel
 * message is received:
 * - The Push Channel message is extracted from the user information dictionary
 *   in the notification.
 * - The message is logged to the system monitor.
 * - The <tt>processPush</tt> function in the application is called and
 *   passed the content of the message.
 *
 * The <tt>processPush</tt> function, which would be written by the
 * application developer, could initiate any of the following actions:
 * - Alert the user that new data is available.
 * - Connect to the application server to retrieve the data. (Connection
 *   could use a socket, an HTTP request, or another means of communication.
 *   From the Push Channel point of view, this is an out-of-band communication.)
 * .
 *
 * <h3>Handle Channel Closure</h3>
 * \code
 * -(void)channelClosedNotification:(NSNotification *)notification
 * {
 *     NSString *data = notification.userInfo[GDPushChannelTokenKey];
 *     NSLog(@"GDPushChannelClosedNotification: %@", data);
 *     myApp.pushIsOpen = NO;
 *     [myApp discardPushToken:data];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a simple channel closure handler. The following takes
 * place when the Push Channel is closed:
 * - The token is logged to the system monitor.
 * - The application flags internally that its channel isn't open.
 * - The application <tt>discardPushToken</tt> function is called. The token
 *   of the closed channel is passed as a parameter.
 * .
 *
 * The <tt>discardPushToken</tt> function would delete the application's
 * copy of the token, possibly after checking that it matches the previous
 * stored token.
 * 
 * The function could also initiate connection of a new Push Channel, which
 * would have a new token. See \reflink GDPushChannel::connect connect \endlink.
 *
 * <h3>Handle Channel Error</h3>
 * \code
 * - (void)channelErrorNotification:(NSNotification *)notification
 * {
 *     NSInteger errorCode = [notification[GDPushChannelErrorKey] integerValue];
 *     NSLog(@"GDPushChannelErrorNotification: %zd", error);
 *     myApp.pushIsOpen = NO;
 *     myApp.pushErr = error;
 *     [myApp discardPushToken];
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a simple <tt>Error</tt> handler.
 *
 * The handler logs the error code to the system monitor, flags
 * the channel's state as not connected, records the error code in
 * the application, then calls the application <tt>discardPushToken</tt>
 * function.
 *
 * The <tt>discardPushToken</tt> function could do any of the following:
 * - Delete the application's copy of the token.
 * - Set the error state in an ongoing status display.
 * - Depending on the error code, initiate connection of a new Push Channel,
 *   which would have a new token. See \reflink GDPushChannel::connect connect \endlink.
 *
 * See under Ping Failure in the \ref GNP for an explanation of the Ping Failure feature.
 *
 * <h3>Handle Ping Failure</h3>
 * \code
 * - (void)channelErrorNotification:(NSNotification *)notification
 * {
 *     NSInteger errorCode = [notification[GDPushChannelErrorKey] integerValue];
 *     NSLog(@"GDPushChannelPingFailedNotification %zd", error);
 *     if ( error == 605 ) {
 *         [myApp resendPushToken];
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above snippet shows a simple Ping Failure handler.
 *
 * The handler logs the error code to the system monitor, then calls the
 * application <tt>resendPushToken</tt> function if the token was lost.
 *
 * The <tt>resendPushToken</tt> function, which would be written by the
 * application developer, would send the application's stored token to the
 * application server. This could use a socket, an HTTP request, or another
 * means of communication. From the Push Channel point of view, this is an
 * out-of-band communication.
 *
 * The <tt>resendPushToken</tt> function should expect that the server is
 * not immediately available, perhaps employing a retry policy.
