/** BlackBerry Dynamics Runtime object interface, including authorization.
 * 
 * This class represents the application's connection to its embedded
 * BlackBerry Dynamics runtime instance, and hence to the wider BlackBerry
 * Dynamics platform infrastructure.
 *
 * The programming interface includes a number of functions that the
 * application must call at particular points in the application execution
 * cycle. The application must also implement a handler for events dispatched
 * from this interface. Calling the functions, and handling the events
 * correctly, ensures compliance with enterprise security policies. This
 * programming interface also includes a number of miscellaneous functions
 * for various purposes, such as setting a custom logo for display in the
 * BlackBerry Dynamics user interface.
 *
 * The application must initialize the runtime object, using this programming
 * interface, prior to using any other BlackBerry Dynamics interface.
 * Initialization will only succeed if the end user has been set up in the
 * enterprise BlackBerry Dynamics management console, and is entitled to use the
 * application.
 * 
 * The user's entitlement to the application may later be revoked or
 * temporarily withdrawn. For example, temporary withdrawal may take place if
 * the user is inactive for a period of time. In either case, the application
 * will be notified with an event or callback from this interface.
 *
 * Successful initialization of the BlackBerry Dynamics interface object also
 * makes the BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure accessible from within the
 * URL Loading System, which includes the native URL session programming
 * interface.
 *
 * @see \ref GC
 * @see <a  HREF="https://docs.blackberry.com/en/endpoint-management/blackberry-uem/"  target="_blank" >Manuals page for the BlackBerry Dynamics enterprise servers</a > for the Platform Overview.
 * @see \ref threads
 * @see \ref background_execution
 * @see \ref GDURLLoadingSystem for proxy infrastructure usage within the URL
 *      Loading System.
 * @see \ref nsurlsession_support for proxy infrastructure usage through the
 *      native URL session programming interface.
 *
 * <h3>BlackBerry Dynamics Platform Connection</h3>
 * Establishing a connection to the BlackBerry Dynamics platform requires
 * authorization of the end user, and of the application. 
 * Both authorizations are initiated by a single call to the <tt>authorize</tt>
 * function.
 *
 * The <tt>authorize</tt> function call is typically made when the
 * application starts, in the
 * <tt>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</tt> handler.
 *
 * Authorization generally includes establishing a data connection to the
 * BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure, and hence to the enterprise that
 * set up the end user entitlement. In addition, authorization will also include
 * any necessary registration of the device, at the BlackBerry Dynamics Network
 * Operation Center (infrastructure activation), and at the enterprise
 * (enterprise activation). See under Activation, below, for more details.
 *
 * Authorization may include user interaction, see the documentation of the
 * authorize function, below, for details. All user interaction that is part
 * of authorization takes place in a user interface that is built into the
 * BlackBerry Dynamics runtime library, not part of the application.
 *
 * The authorization programming interface is state-based and asynchronous. The
 * initiation function generally returns immediately. Success or failure of
 * authorization is then notified to the application code later, as a transition
 * of the <em>authorization state</em>. The application should generally wait to
 * be notified of transition to the "authorized" state before attempting to
 * utilize any other BlackBerry Dynamics interfaces.
 *
 * Further changes to the authorization state can take place, and are notified
 * to the application in the same way. See under Authorization State, below.
 *
 * @see \ref enterprisesimulation for instructions on building an application to
 *      run in a special limited mode in which authorization with the enterprise
 *      is only simulated.
 * @see <a 
    href="https://developers.blackberry.com/content/dam/developer-blackberry-com/resource-assets/pdf/NOC%20server%20addresses.pdf"
    target="_blank"
    >Network Operation Center server addresses</a> on the application developer
 * portal, for IP address and port number details of the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * Network Operation Center services.
 *
 * <h3>Authorization State</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime maintains the authorization state of the
 * application. The programming interfaces that can be utilized by the
 * application depend on its current authorization state.
 *
 * The initial state of the application when it starts is <em>not
 * authorized</em>. In this state the application can utilize the authorization
 * processing initiation interface but cannot utilize any principal interfaces,
 * such as secure store access and secure communication.
 *
 * After authorization has been initiated and has succeeded, the application
 * enters the <em>authorized </em>state. The principal interfaces can then be
 * utilized.
 *
 * Authorization of the end user may be temporarily withdrawn, in which case the
 * application enters the <em>locked </em>state. This would happen when, for
 * example, the user doesn't interact with the application for an extended
 * period and the enterprise inactivity time out expires. Note that the
 * authorization of the application itself has not been withdrawn in this state,
 * only the authorization of the end user to access the application's data.\n
 * In the locked state, the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime superimposes an unlock
 * screen on the application user interface to prevent the user from interacting
 * with it or viewing its data. Note that the runtime doesn't block the whole
 * device user interface, which means that native notification features and
 * other ancillary mechanisms
 * could still be utilized by the application. The application mustn't cause
 * sensitive enterprise data to be displayed through these features and
 * mechanisms when in the locked state.\n
 * The application can continue to utilize the principal BlackBerry Dynamics
 * interfaces, in the background.
 *
 * After a temporary withdrawal ends, the application returns to the authorized
 * state. This would happen when, for example, the user enters their security
 * password in the unlock screen.
 *
 * Authorization may also be permanently withdrawn, in which case the
 * application enters the <em>wiped </em>state. This would happen when, for
 * example, the end user's entitlement to the application is removed by the
 * enterprise administrator. In the wiped state, the application cannot utilize
 * the principal BlackBerry Dynamics interfaces.
 * 
 * Transitions of the authorization state are notified as follows.
 * - A <tt>GDAppEvent</tt> is dispatched to the
 *   <tt>GDiOSDelegate</tt> instance in the
 *   application. The event will have a number of attributes, including a type
 *   value that indicates whether the user is now authorized.
 * - A <tt>GDStateChangeNotification</tt> is posted to any registered
 *   NSNotification observers. See the \link GDState \endlink class reference for
 *   how to register.
 * - The <tt>isAuthorized</tt> property of the \reflink GDiOS::state state (GDiOS) \endlink object
 *   changes value, which can be notified by key-value observing (KVO). See
 *   again the \link GDState \endlink class reference for details.
 * .
 * 
 * The authorization states and their corresponding event type values are listed
 * in the following table.
  <table>

          The application cannot use any interfaces.</td
      ><td
          ><tt>GDAppEventNotAuthorized</tt>\n
          This is the same event type as the Locked state transition event.</td
 
      ></tr
  ></table
  >The transitions in the above table are also shown in the
 * \ref st04gdauthorisation.
 *
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime user interface includes all the necessary
 * screens and messages to inform the user of the authorization state. The
 * application code needs only to ensure:
 * - That it doesn't bypass the runtime user interface.
 * - That it doesn't attempt to access the principal interfaces prior to
 *   authorization.
 * - That it doesn't attempt to access the principal interfaces after the
 *   authorization state has changed to wiped.
 * .
 * An authorized application may change an authorization state to 'locked'
 * and prompt the user to reauthenticate by using \reflink GDAuthenticationManager GDAuthenticationManager \endlink.
 *
 * 
 * <h3>Programming interface restrictions</h3>
 * The application cannot use any of the principal BlackBerry Dynamics
 * interfaces before authorization has succeeded. If the application attempts to
 * do so, the runtime generates an assertion,
 * which results in the application being terminated.
 * The runtime uses the Foundation <tt>NSAssert</tt> macro to generate these
 * assertions.
 *
 * The runtime doesn't generate assertions for
 * transient conditions, but only for apparent programming errors in the
 * application. Consequently, these assertions are
 * only expected when the application is in development, and not when the
 * application is in production. The failure message of the
 * assertion will describe the programming
 * error.
 *
 * The recommended approach is that the application should be allowed to
 * terminate, so that the failure message can be read
 * on the console.
 * The failure message will describe the programming error, which can then be
 * corrected.
 * For example, a message like the following could be seen in the logs:\n
 * <tt>My application [7506:40b] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception
 * 'NSInternalInconsistencyException', reason:
 * 'Not authorized. Call [GDi</tt><tt>OS autho</tt><tt>rize] first.'</tt>
 *
 * <h4>First usage of BlackBerry Dynamics in the execution cycle</h4>
 * The typical first usage of the BlackBerry Dynamics programming interface in
 * the execution cycle is to initiate authorization, in the
 * <tt>application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</tt> handler. The first point
 * in the execution cycle at which it is possible to use the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * interface is the invocation of the
 * <tt>application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</tt> handler. The BlackBerry
 * Dynamics programming interface cannot be used prior to
 * <tt>application:willFinishLaunchingWithOptions:</tt> invocation. For example,
 * if the application uses a subclass of <tt>UIApplication</tt>, the BlackBerry
 * Dynamics programming interface cannot be used in its <tt>init</tt> method.
 *
 * <h3>Activation</h3>
 * In BlackBerry Dynamics, activation refers to a number of registration
 * procedures that must be completed in order to access all platform
 * capabilities. Once a particular activation has been completed, registration
 * credentials are stored on the device. This means that each activation need
 * only be processed once.
 *
 * Activations are generally transparent to the application. The application
 * will call a BlackBerry Dynamics authorization method, and the runtime will
 * process whichever activations are required.
 *
 * There are two activations in BlackBerry Dynamics.<dl
  ><dt
      >Infrastructure activation</dt><dd
          >Recognition of the application instance as a terminal by the
          BlackBerry Dynamics central server.</dd
  ><dt
      >Enterprise activation</dt><dd
          >Association of the terminal with a provisioned end user at the
          enterprise. This requires activation credentials, which may be
          obtained by any of the following means.
          - Entered manually into the BlackBerry Dynamics user interface.
          - Retrieved progammatically via another BlackBerry Dynamics
            application, known as Easy Activation.
          .</dd
  ></dl>
 * @see \ref GC.
 * @see \ref enterprisesimulation for instructions on building an application to
 *      run in a special limited mode in which there is no enterprise
 *      activation.
 *
 * <h3>Identification</h3>
 * Every BlackBerry Dynamics application has a unique identifier and version
 * for the purposes of entitlement management, publishing, and service provider
 * registration. The identifier was previously referred to as the Good Dynamics
 * application identifier, or in the abbreviated form GD App ID, but is now
 * referred to as the <em>entitlement identifier</em>.
 *
 * Entitlement identifiers are used:
 * - In the application.
 * - In the BlackBerry Dynamics management console at the enterprise.
 * - In some administrative user interfaces accessible via the application
 *   developer portal.
 * .
 *
 * A BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement identifier is generally accompanied by a
 * separate entitlement version.
 *
 * In the mobile application, the entitlement identifier and version values are
 * set by the authorization call, as documented in the <tt>authorize</tt>
 * function reference, below. In the management console, the entitlement
 * identifier and version values are entered as part of application management.
 *
 * @see \ref GC.
 *
 * <h4>Entitlement Identifier Format</h4>
 * Entitlement identifiers are textual and follow a typical naming convention.
 * The reversed Internet domain of the application developer forms the initial
 * part of the identifier. For example, applications developed by BlackBerry can
 * have identifiers that begin "com.blackberry." because BlackBerry owns the
 * blackberry.com Internet domain.
 *
 * The rest of the identifier is made up of the application's name, possibly
 * preceded by a number of categories and sub-categories. Categories and
 * sub-categories are separated by full stops. For example, the identifier of an
 * example remote database application, made by BlackBerry, could be:
 * "com.blackberry.gd.examples.remotedb". Note that BlackBerry also owns the
 * good.com domain, so could also use "com.good.gd.examples.remotedb".
 * 
 * Formally, the syntax of an entitlement identifer is a string that:
 * - Contains only the following ASCII characters: hyphen (dash), full stop
 *   (period), numeric digit, lower-case letter.
 * - Conforms to the &lt;subdomain&gt; format initially defined in section 2.3.1
 *   of <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1035.txt" 
            target="_blank" >RFC1035</a>
     and subsequently modified in section 2.1 of
     <a href="http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1123.txt" target="_blank" >RFC1123</a>.
 * .
 *
 * <h4>Entitlement Version Format</h4>
 * A BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement version is a string made up of a sequence
 * of numbers separated by full stops (periods). The following represents best
 * practice.
 * - The first release of the application should have "1.0.0.0" as its
 *   entitlement version.
 * - The version string should change in subsequent releases in which one of the
 *   following software changes is made:
 *   - The application starts to provide a new shared service or shared service
 *     version.
 *   - The application stops providing a shared service or shared service
 *     version.
 *   .
 *   Otherwise, version should not change in the release.
 * .
 *
 * See the \reflink GDService GDService class reference\endlink for details of shared services.
 *
 * The syntax rules of entitlement version values are as follows.
 * - A version string consists of one to four version numbers separated by full
 *   stop (period) characters.
 * - A version number consists of one of the following:
 *   - A single zero.
 *   - A sequence of up to three digits with no leading zero.
 *   .
 * .
 * The syntax can be formally expressed as the following regular expression:
 * <tt>(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,2})(.(0|[1-9][0-9]{0,2})){0,3}</tt>
 * 
 * Don't use a different entitlement version for an early access or beta
 * software release. Instead, add a suffix to the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * entitlement identifier and native application identifier used for general
 * access. For example, the entitlement identifier "com.example.gdapp.beta"
 * could be used to identify a "com.example.gdapp" beta release.\n
 * Using a different native identifier makes it possible for general access and
 * early access software to be installed on the same mobile device, and
 * facilitates use of different signing certificates.
 *
 * <h3>Application user interface restrictions</h3>
 * See the \ref AppUserInterfaceRestrictions page.
 *
 * <h3>Build-Time Configuration</h3>
 * See the \ref BuildTimeConfiguration page.
 *
 * <h3>Enterprise Configuration Information</h3>
 * There are a number of functions in this class for obtaining enterprise
 * configuration information, including settings that apply to the current end
 * user. The \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationPolicy getApplicationPolicy (GDiOS) \endlink and
 * \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink functions are examples of this
 * type of function.
 *
 * All the functions of this type:
 * - Return their results in a collection of objects.
 * - Have a corresponding \reflink GDAppEvent GDAppEvent \endlink event type that is
 *   dispatched to the application's 
 *   \reflink GDiOSDelegate GDiOSDelegate \endlink 
 *   instance when the result would change.
 * - Have a corresponding <tt>NSNotification</tt> that is posted to any
 *   registered observers, when the result would change. See the
 *   \link GDState \endlink class reference for how to register.
 *
 *
 * For example, the \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationPolicy getApplicationPolicy (GDiOS) \endlink function returns 
 * an <tt>NSDictionary</tt>
 * collection. When there is a change,
 * a <tt>GDPolicyUpdateNotification</tt> is posted, and
 * a <tt>GDAppEventPolicyUpdate</tt> event is dispatched.
 *
 * Use these functions as follows.
 * -# Make a first call to get an initial collection.
 * -# Retain the collection, and refer to it in any code that utilizes its
 *    values.
 * -# When the update event is received, discard the retained collection and
 *    call the function again to get a new collection.
 *
 *
 * Don't make a subsequent call to the same function until an update event
 * has been received. The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime generates a new collection
 * for each call to one of these functions. If the application code makes
 * multiple calls and retains all the returned collections, then they will all
 * consume memory or other application resources.
 * 
 * <h2>Code Snippets</h2> The following code snippets illustrate some common tasks.
 * <h3>Authorization</h3>
 * The following snippet shows initiation of BlackBerry Dynamics authorization.
 * \code
 * [GDiOS sharedInstance].delegate = self;
 * [[GDiOS sharedInstance] authorize];
 * \endcode
 * After executing the above code, the application would wait for its delegate
 * callback to be invoked. The invocation would have an event type of
 * <tt>GDAppEventAuthorized</tt> if the user was authorized. After that, the
 * application could make full use of all BlackBerry Dynamics capabilities.
 *
 * The above code relies on the identification parameters being in the
 * Info.plist file, as shown in the following snippet.
 * \code
 * <key>GDApplicationID</key>
 * <string>com.example.browser</string>
 * <key>GDApplicationVersion</key>
 * <string>1.0.0.0</string>
 * \endcode
 * The above is an extract from the XML of the application's Info.plist file.
 * The extract sets "com.example.browser" as the BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement
 * identifer, and "1.0.0.0" as the BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement version.
 *
 * <h3>User interface pre-initialization</h3>
 * The following snippet shows some necessary steps that precede initialization
 * of the application's user interface. The recommended place in the code for
 * these steps is as shown in the snippet.
 * \code
 *
 * - (BOOL)application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
 * { 
 *     GDiOS *gdiOS = [GDiOS sharedInstance];
 *     gdiOS.delegate = self;
 *     started = NO;
 *     // Following line will cause the BlackBerry Dynamics user interface to open.
 *     [gdiOS authorize];
 *     return YES;
 * }
 * \endcode
 *
 * The above snippet shows the following sequence of actions.
 * -# A reference to the GDiOS singleton object is obtained.
 * -# The current class is set as the delegated event handler.
 * -# The <tt>started</tt> flag is set, to control initialization of the
 *    application's user interface, which is covered in the following snippet.
 *    The flag's declaration (not shown) would be <tt>BOOL</tt>.
 * -# The application initiates BlackBerry Dynamics authorization.
 * .
 * Authorization processing is asynchronous. On completion, an event will be
 * dispatched to the application's handler. The application completes user
 * interface initialization within its event handler, as shown in the following
 * code snippet.
 *
 * <h3>User interface initialization</h3>
 * The following snippet shows the recommended place in the code to initialize
 * the application's user interface.
 * \code
 *
 * -(void)handleEvent:(GDAppEvent*)anEvent
 * {
 *     switch (anEvent.type) {
 *         case GDAppEventAuthorized: {
 *             if (!started) {
 *                 [self initializeUI];
 *                 started = YES;
 *             }
 *             break;
 *         }
 *
 *         case GDAppEventNotAuthorized: {
 *             [self onNotAuthorized:anEvent];
 *             break;
 *         }
 *
 *         case GDAppEventRemoteSettingsUpdate:
 *         case GDAppEventServicesUpdate:
 *         case GDAppEventPolicyUpdate:
 *         default: {
 *             // This application ignores other types of event.
 *             break;
 *         }
 *     }
 * }
 * \endcode
 * The above code shows a simple BlackBerry Dynamics runtime event handler.
 *
 * The handler calls the application's own <tt>initializeUI</tt> function when a
 * <tt>GDAppEventAuthorized</tt> event is received for the first time. The
 * application's <tt>started</tt> flag is used to control first-time execution.
 * Initialization of this flag is shown in the previous snippet.\n
 * The <tt>initializeUI</tt> function would complete user interface
 * initialization, utilizing a reference to the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime
 * <tt>UIWindow</tt>. This reference can be obtained using the <tt>window</tt>
 * property from the main app delegate.
 *
 * The handler calls the application's own <tt>onNotAuthorized</tt> function
 * whenever a <tt>GDAppEventNotAuthorized</tt> event is received.

 * console, and made available to the runtime instance embedded in the
 * application. See under Activation, above, for the methods by which the key
 * can be made available.
 *
 * During enterprise activation, the runtime sends the key to the NOC. If the
 * key is recognized, the application instance is associated with the enterprise
 * that created the key. Enterprise registration credentials are then issued,
 * and encrypted and stored locally by the runtime.\n
 * Enterprise activation is not processed if enterprise registration
 * credentials are already present.\n
 * Note that successful enterprise activation has the effect of consuming the
 * access key. This will be the case even if a later stage of authorization
 * processing fails, or if it is found that the user isn't entitled to this
 * application.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Entitlement checking</dt><dd>
 * The enterprise that provisioned the end user can later withdraw the
 * user's entitlement to the application. Withdrawal is flagged in the
 * enterprise's management console. The runtime checks the end user's ongoing
 * entitlement to the application every time authorization is processed. (In
 * addition, withdrawal may be notified to the runtime by the NOC.)\n
 * In the management console, entitlement is given to particular versions of
 * particular applications. The entitlement version and identifier values built
 * into the application must match exactly with a version and identifier to
 * which the user has been given entitlement in the management console. If there
 * isn't an exact match, then user entitlement is assumed to have been
 * withdrawn.\n
 * If the user is found not to be entitled, then the runtime deletes all locally
 * stored application data and authentication credentials.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Policy update</dt><dd>
 * Policies govern many aspects of the BlackBerry Dynamics user experience. For
 * example, the minimum characteristics of the end user's security password with
 * respect to length and types of character are governed by a policy. So is the
 * need for the end user to set a security password. The runtime checks for and
 * retrieves updated policies every time authorization is processed.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Policy checking</dt><dd>
 * The runtime checks for compliance with the most up-to-date policies every
 * time authorization is processed.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Configuration retrieval</dt><dd>
 * The runtime retrieves a set of application configuration settings from the
 * enterprise management console during authorization processing. These will
 * have been stored in the management console. See under
 * \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink for a list of settings.</dd>
 *
 * <dt>Unlock secure store</dt><dd>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics secure store is unlocked during authorization. If the
 * store is protected by an end-user password, then the user must enter their
 * password for authorization processing to complete. Password entry takes place
 * in a BlackBerry Dynamics user interface, not in the application user
 * interface.</dd>

 * Enterprise activation and Password entry, are opened and closed as needed,
 * without reference to the application.

 * If DLP is switched on, the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime will:<ul>
 * <li>
 *     Secure general cut-copy-paste operations by the user.</li>
 * <li>
 *     Secure data written to the general pasteboard
 *     by content-rendering <tt>UIKit</tt> components.</li>
 *   </ul>
 *  Secure cut-copy-paste  
 *  operations allow the user to copy and move data via the clipboard
 *  only:
 * - Within one BlackBerry Dynamics application.
 * - Between BlackBerry Dynamics applications, on the same device, that were activated
 *   for the same end user from the same enterprise management console.
 * - Between BlackBerry Dynamics applications, on multiple iOS and macOS devices
 *   conforming to Apple Continuity system requirements, that were activated
 *   for the same end user from the same enterprise management console.
 * .
 * Other aspects of data leakage must be enforced by the application.\n 
 * Note that pasteboards other than the general pasteboard, i.e.
 * programmatically created <tt>UIPasteboard</tt> instances, are never secured
 * by the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime.\n
 * @see <a
 href="https://support.apple.com/en-ca/HT204681#clipboard"
 target="_blank"> Universal Clipboard</a> on the apple.com support website. \n
 * \n \par Application Server Selection
 * The <tt>GDAppConfigKeyServers</tt> value will contain a list of the servers
 * that have been configured for the application in the enterprise management
 * console. In the case that more than one server has been configured, the
 * recommended selection algorithm is as follows:
 * -# For each priority value in the list, starting with the highest:
 * -# Select a server that has that priority, at random.
 * -# Attempt to connect to the server.
 * -# If connection succeeds, use that server.
 * -# If connection fails, try another server at the same priority, at random.
 * -# If there are no more untried servers at that priority, try the servers at
 *    the next lower priority.

/** Get providers of shared services.
 * 
 * This function returns a list of all available providers of
 * shared services. The list contains both application-based and server-based
 * service providers.
 *
 * The returned list is based on the BlackBerry Dynamics entitlement
 * configuration in the enterprise management console and in the central
 * BlackBerry Dynamics Catalog. An entitlement can correspond to an application,
 * or can be a placeholder for something more abstract such as access to a
 * feature or resource. In any case, entitlements have unique identifiers and
 * versions.
 *
 * The list includes an entry for each entitlement version that meets all the
 * following conditions.
 * - The entitlement version is registered as the provider of one or more shared
 *   services, see notes on service provider registrations, below.
 * - The end user that activated the running application has been granted the
 *   entitlement version, i.e. they are entitled to the service provider.
 * - For entitlements that represent application-based service providers: the
 *   corresponding application has been installed and activated for the same end
 *   user, and on the same device or computer, as the current application.
 * .
 *
 * On devices running iOS version 9 or later, the list could include providers
 * of application-based services that were installed and activated as above, but
 * then uninstalled. An attempt to send a service request to an application that
 * is not currently installed results in a
 * <tt>GDServicesErrorApplicationNotFound</tt> error.
 *
 * <em>Service provider registrations</em> are stored within the BlackBerry
 * Dynamics infrastructure, on a server known as the Catalog. Registrations are
 * stored as relationships between entitlement versions and service identifiers.
 * The user interface for registration administration is either the enterprise
 * management console, or a website that can be reached via the application
 * developer portal. The same user interfaces are used for the creation and
 * administration of individual shared service definitions.
 * 
 * The runtime retrieves the information used to generate the list of service
 * providers from the Catalog, and from the enterprise management console.
 * Retrieval can take place when the application is authorized, or when another
 * application activates on the same device, or when the configuration is
 * changed in the enterprise management console. Note that retrieval isn't as
 * such triggered by calling this function.
 * 
 * For each entitlement version that satisfies the above conditions, this
 * function returns a \reflink GDServiceProvider GDServiceProvider \endlink object.
 *
 * The returned details for an application-based provider can be used to send a
 * service request to the service provider using BlackBerry Dynamics
 * AppKinetics. See the \reflink GDService GDService class reference\endlink for details of the programming
 * interface. See under Service Provider Requirements on that page for
 * information on service provider registration, which is a prerequisite for an
 * application to be on the list returned by this function.
 *
 * The returned details for a server-based provider can be used to establish
 * HTTP or TCP socket communications with a server instance.

 *         > objects containing the list of available service providers. The
 *         order of objects in the list is unspecified.

 * A single service could have multiple providers. A single provider could
 * provide multiple services, and multiple versions of services.
 *
 * When changed details have been retrieved by the runtime, a
 * <tt>GDAppEventServicesUpdate</tt> event will be dispatched to the
 * application. See the \reflink GDAppEvent GDAppEvent \endlink class reference for details,
 * and see the notes under the Enterprise Configuration Information heading,

 * <h4>Icon images</h4>
 * The objects returned by this function can include icon images for service

 * - Key: <tt>GDFetchResources</tt>
 * - Type: <tt>Boolean</tt>
 * - Value: <tt>YES</tt>
 * .
 * (*In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one has
 * been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being built.
 * The setting just made should appear there.)
 *
 * If the setting is missing or the value is <tt>NO</tt>, this indicates that
 * the application doesn't utilize icon images.
 *
 * The data for icon images would be retrieved by the BlackBerry Dynamics
 * runtime, from a BlackBerry Dynamics Catalog service. BlackBerry may switch

/** Whether it is possible to authorize autonomously.
 *
 * Access this property to check
 * whether autonomous authorization is possible. Autonomous authorization won't
 * be possible if the application is protected by a BlackBerry Dynamics
 * password. This means a password or other interactive authentication that is
 * enforced by the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime.
 *
 * Interactive authentication will be enforced by BlackBerry Dynamics unless a
 * <em>no-password</em> policy applies to the current end user. A no-password
 * policy would typically be put in place only in the case that interactive
 * authentication is enforced by some other means. For example, enterprise
 * mobile device management (MDM) can be used to force users to set a device
 * password or lock pattern. In that case, the enterprise might choose to set a
 * no-password policy for BlackBerry Dynamics, so that end users don't have to
 * enter two passwords.
 *
 * If interactive authentication isn't enforced by BlackBerry Dynamics, then it
 * is possible for authorization processing to complete autonomously, because
 * interaction with the user isn't required.
 *
 * The intended use of this property is to check
 * whether it is possible for authorization processing to complete autonomously,
 * before calling the
 * \reflink GDiOS::authorizeAutonomously: authorizeAutonomously: (GDiOS) \endlink function.
 * 
 * Note that it won't be possible to authorize autonomously if enterprise
 * policy specifies that the application delegates authentication to another
 * application. This would only happen if the current end user somehow had both
 * policies in place: authentication delegation, and no-password. This
 * combination isn't recommended. There would seem to be no point in delegating
 * authentication to another application if that other application is going to
 * authenticate the end user without interaction.
 *
 * This property can be accessed before
 * authorization processing is complete.
 * 
 * This property has the value:
 * - <tt>YES</tt> if autonomous authorization is possible.
 * - <tt>NO</tt> if a password is enforced by BlackBerry Dynamics, or if
 *             autonomous authorization isn't possible for some other reason.

 * to utilise the application. The user cannot unlock the application in the
 * normal way, for example they cannot enter their BlackBerry Dynamics password,

 * obtained from the management console, and entered in the remote unlock
 * BlackBerry Dynamics user interface.
 *
 * @see \reflink GDAppEvent GDAppEvent \endlink class reference, which mentions the
