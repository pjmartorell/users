 *
 *
 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics socket programming interface is asynchronous and
 * state-based. The application attaches its own event-handler callbacks to the
 * socket object. The callback functions are invoked when socket events occur,
 * or when the socket changes state. Which functions can be called by the
 * application at any time depend on the socket's state.
 *
 * Callbacks are attached through a delegate class. The states in which each
 * callback may be expected to be invoked are detailed in the delegate class's
 * documentation, see \ref GDSocketDelegate.
 *
 * The availability of functions, and what actions take place, are detailed
 * below, and summarized in the following table. The table also summarizes which
 * callbacks may expect to be invoked in each state.
 * <table>
 *     <tr><th>State</th><th>Functions / Actions</th><th>Expected callbacks</th>
 *
 *     </tr><tr><td>
 *         Prepared</td>
 *     <td>
 *         Application can call <tt>connect</tt>: state becomes Connecting\n
 *         Application can call <tt>disableHostVerification</tt>:
 *         no state change\n
 *         Application can call <tt>disablePeerVerification</tt>:
 *         no state change</td>
 *     <td>
 *         None</td>

 *         Open socket connection to server</td>

 *         None</td>
 *
 *     </tr>
 * </table>
 * The transitions in the above table are also shown in the
 * \ref st02gdsocket
 *
 * <h3>Sending and Receiving Data</h3>
 * Sending data through a BlackBerry Dynamics socket is a two-stage operation.
 * The first stage is to add the data to the socket's outbound buffer. The
 * socket's outbound buffer is represented by the <tt>writestream</tt> property,
 * and is accessed using the BlackBerry Dynamics direct byte buffer interface.
 * The second stage is to send the contents of the buffer through the socket
 * connection. To send the buffer, call the <tt>write</tt> function.
 *
 * Reading data from a BlackBerry Dynamics socket is asynchronous. When data is
 * received at the device, the data is stored in the socket's inbound buffer.
 * The application is then notified that data is available to read, by
 * invocation of the delegate <tt>onRead</tt> callback. In the callback, the
 * application consumes the received data from the inbound buffer. The inbound
 * buffer is represented by the <tt>readStream</tt> property, and is
 * accessed using the BlackBerry Dynamics direct byte buffer interface.
 *
 * <h3>SSL/TLS Security</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics socket interface supports use of a Secure Socket
 * Layer or Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to send and receive data.
 *
 * Using SSL/TLS requires that the remote end has a suitable certificate, and
 * that the certificate is valid.
 * A number of checks for validity are made by the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime,
 * some of which can be switched off by the application.

 * A typical secure socket connection sequence would be as follows. The
 * application makes a first connection attempt. In the first attempt, all
 * checking is switched on. If a security error is encountered, this attempt
 * will fail. The application can then switch off some checking, and make a
 * second connection attempt to the same address as the first connection
 * attempt. With less rigorous checking, the second attempt may succeed where
 * the first failed.
 *
 * The relevant parts of the API are:
 * - Use of SSL/TLS is specified by including
 *   <tt>andUseSSL:</tt>&nbsp;<tt>YES</tt> in the call to the <tt>init</tt>
 *   function.
 * - Security errors are treated the same as connection failures.
 * - The functions <tt>disableHostVerification</tt> and
 *   <tt>disablePeerVerification</tt> are used to reduce the level
 *   of security checking. Setting <tt>disablePeerVerification</tt> implicitly
 *   sets <tt>disableHostVerification</tt>.
 * .
 * <h4>Secure Protocol Selection</h4>
 * Establishing an SSL/TLS connection can involve negotiating and retrying, in
 * order to select a secure protocol that is supported by both client and
 * server. The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime handles client-side negotiation and
 * retrying, if secure communication is in use.
 *
 * By default, the runtime won't offer the TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols for
 * SSL/TLS connections with an application server.
 *
 * The runtime can be configured to offer these protocols, as follows.
 * -# Add a new row to the application's Info.plist file:
 *     - Key: <tt>GDControlTLSVersions</tt>
 *     - Type: <tt>String</tt> (the default)
 *     .
 * -# Set the value to:
 *     - <tt>GDEnableTLS1.1</tt> to enable the TLSv1.1 protocol.
 *     - <tt>GDEnableTLS1.2</tt> to enable both TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 *     .
 *     As an alternative, the value can instead be an array containing one or
 *     both of the above strings as separate items.
 * .
 * (*In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one has
 * been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being built.
 * The setting just made should appear there.)
 * 
 * The setting only affects connections to application servers, not the
 * connection with the BlackBerry Dynamics infrastructure itself. The protocols
 * aren't offered by default because there are many installed web servers with
 * which a connection cannot be established after one of these protocols has
 * been offered.
 *
 * In addition to the above, the following protocol versions can be blocked by
 * enterprise management console configuration.
 * <div class="bulletlists">
 * - SSLv3
 * - TLSv1.0
 * - TLSv1.1
 * - TLSv1.2
 * .
 * </div>
 *
 * The configuration of blocked protocol versions can be done in the enterprise
 * management console user interface. The configuration applies at the
 * deployment level and isn't specific to user, policy group, or application
 * server. The block only affects communication with application servers that is
 * routed via the BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure.
 *
 * <h3>Enterprise server connection notes</h3>
 * BlackBerry Dynamics secure communication can be used to connect to servers
 * that are behind the enterprise firewall. This applies to socket connections
 * and HTTP requests. Note the following when using this capability.
 *
 * The addresses of any application servers to which connection is being made
 * must be configured in the enterprise management console. The address could be
 * registered as the application's server, or as an additional server, for
 * example.
 *
 * Note. The application server configuration set in the management console can
 * be obtained in the application code by using the
 * \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink function.
 *
 * The connection to the application server will be made through the BlackBerry
 * Dynamics proxy infrastructure. The status of the application's connection to
 * the proxy infrastructure can be checked and monitored by using the
 * GDReachability interface.
 *
 * @see \ref GC
 * @see \reflink GDReachability GDReachability \endlink class reference.

 *
 * @deprecated
 * This class is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. BlackBerry
 * Dynamics secures the native NSURLSession and NSURLConnection programming
 * interfaces, which should be used instead. For reference, see
 * \ref nsurlsession_support and \ref GDURLLoadingSystem. For example code, see

 *
 * This class is for sending Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests, such
 * as GET and POST, from a front-end application on a mobile device to a
 * back-end application server. The application server can be on the Internet,
 * or behind the enterprise firewall. The programming interface is based on the

 *
 * <h3>Overview</h3>
 * An instance of this class represents an HTTP request. The programming
 * interface is state-based. The availability of functions to be called by the
 * application at any given time depend on the current state of the request.
 *
 * Requests can be processed synchronously or asynchronously, at the option of
 * the application. For asychronous operation, the application attaches its own
 * event-handler callback to the request object. The callback function is
 * invoked when events occur, or when the request changes state.
 *
 * The callback is attached through a delegate class. Invocation of the callback
 * is detailed in the delegate class's documentation, see GDHttpRequestDelegate.
 *
 * The availability of interface functions, and what actions take place, are
 * detailed below and summarized in the following table. (States in all-capitals
 * are standard XHR ready states.)<table>
 *     <tr><th>Ready State</th><th>Functions / Actions</th>

 * </table>
 * <h3>Enterprise server connection notes</h3>
 * BlackBerry Dynamics secure communication can be used to connect to servers
 * that are behind the enterprise firewall. This applies to socket connections
 * and HTTP requests. Note the following when using this capability.
 *
 * The addresses of any application servers to which connection is being made
 * must be configured in the enterprise management console. The address could be
 * registered as the application's server, or as an additional server, for
 * example.
 *
 * Note. The application server configuration set in the management console can
 * be obtained in the application code by using the
 * \reflink GDiOS::getApplicationConfig getApplicationConfig (GDiOS) \endlink function.
 *
 * The connection to the application server will be made through the BlackBerry
 * Dynamics proxy infrastructure. The status of the application's connection to
 * the proxy infrastructure can be checked and monitored by using the
 * GDReachability interface.
 *
 * @see \ref GC
 * @see \reflink GDReachability GDReachability \endlink class reference.
 * 
<h3>HTTPS Security</h3>
 * BlackBerry Dynamics secure communication supports HTTPS, using a Secure
 * Socket Layer connection or Transport Layer Security (SSL/TLS) to send an HTTP
 * request and receive a response.
 *
 * Using SSL/TLS requires that the remote end has a suitable certificate, and
 * that the certificate is valid.
 * A number of checks for validity are made by the BlackBerry Dynamics runtime,
 * some of which can be switched off by the application.
 *
 * A typical HTTPS request sequence would be as follows. The application makes a
 * first attempt to send the HTTPS request. In the first attempt, all checking
 * is switched on. If a security error is encountered, this request will fail.
 * The application can then switch off some checking, and attempt to send a
 * second request to the same address as the first request. With less rigorous
 * checking, the second attempt may succeed where the first failed.
 *
 * The relevant parts of the programming interface are:
 * - Use of HTTPS is specified by addressing the request to a URL with "https"
 *   as its scheme, as in "https://www.example.com".
 * - Security errors are treated the same as connection failures. The
 *   <tt>getStatusText</tt> return value will begin with <tt>"SSL"</tt>.
 * - The functions <tt>disableHostVerification</tt> and
 *   <tt>disablePeerVerification</tt> can be used to reduce the level of
 *   security checking. Setting <tt>disablePeerVerification</tt> implicitly sets
 *   <tt>disableHostVerification</tt>.
 * .
 * <h4>Secure Protocol Selection</h4>
 * Establishing an SSL/TLS connection can involve negotiating and retrying, in
 * order to select a secure protocol that is supported by both client and
 * server. The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime handles client-side negotiation and
 * retrying, if secure communication is in use.
 *
 * By default, the runtime won't offer the TLSv1.1 or TLSv1.2 protocols for
 * SSL/TLS connections with an application server.
 *
 * The runtime can be configured to offer these protocols, as follows.
 * -# Add a new row to the application's Info.plist file:
 *     - Key: <tt>GDControlTLSVersions</tt>
 *     - Type: <tt>String</tt> (the default)
 *     .
 * -# Set the value to:
 *     - <tt>GDEnableTLS1.1</tt> to enable the TLSv1.1 protocol.
 *     - <tt>GDEnableTLS1.2</tt> to enable both TLSv1.1 and TLSv1.2 protocols.
 *     .
 *     As an alternative, the value can instead be an array containing one or
 *     both of the above strings as separate items.
 * .
 * (*In case there are multiple Info.plist files, check that the correct one has
 * been edited by opening the Info tab of the application target being built.
 * The setting just made should appear there.)
 * 
 * The setting only affects connections to application servers, not the
 * connection with the BlackBerry Dynamics infrastructure itself. The protocols
 * aren't offered by default because there are many installed web servers with
 * which a connection cannot be established after one of these protocols has
 * been offered.
 *
 * In addition to the above, the following protocol versions can be blocked by
 * enterprise management console configuration.
 * <div class="bulletlists">
 * - SSLv3
 * - TLSv1.0
 * - TLSv1.1
 * - TLSv1.2
 * .
 * </div>
 *
 * The configuration of blocked protocol versions can be done in the enterprise
 * management console user interface. The configuration applies at the
 * deployment level and isn't specific to user, policy group, or application
 * server. The block only affects communication with application servers that is
 * routed via the BlackBerry Dynamics proxy infrastructure.
 * 
<h3>HTTP proxy support</h3>
 * HTTP and HTTPS requests can be relayed by an HTTP
 * or HTTPS
 * proxy that resides on the Internet or behind the enterprise firewall.
 * Authentication with the proxy is supported.
 *
 * See the \link
 * GDHttpRequest::enableHttpProxy:withPort:withUser:withPass:withAuth:
 * enableHttpProxy:\endlink and \link
 * GDHttpRequest::disableHttpProxy disableHttpProxy\endlink reference
 * documentation for details.
 *
 * When making HTTPS requests through an HTTP proxy, SSL/TLS certificate
 * verification must be switched off. Certificate verification while using an
 * HTTP proxy isn't supported. See under HTTPS Security, above.
 * BlackBerry Dynamics HTTP data communication doesn't go via the proxy
 * specified in the device's native settings, if any.
 * 
<h3>HTTP authentication</h3>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime supports the following mechanisms for
 * authentication with HTTP servers: Basic Access, Digest Access, NTLM, and
 * Kerberos. Except for Kerberos, all these mechanisms are also supported for
 * authentication with HTTP proxies.
 *
 * <h4>Kerberos Authentication</h4>
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime supports Kerberos version 5 authentication.
 * If using Kerberos authentication:
 * - Supply username and password credentials
 * as documented in the relevant function references.
 * - The username must be in the <em>user</em><tt>\@</tt><em>realm</em> long
 *   form. The short form <em>shortrealm</em><tt>\\</tt><em>user</em> isn't
 *   supported.
 * - The BlackBerry Dynamics runtime will use these credentials to request
 *   Kerberos tickets. The tickets are persisted on the device in the BlackBerry
 *   Dynamics secure store. (The ticket store isn't generally accessible to the
 *   application, but see \reflink  GDCacheController::clearCredentialsForMethod:  clearCredentialsForMethod: \endlink.)
 * - The stored Kerberos tickets are then used to authenticate the user on any
 *   site that supports Kerberos authentication. So long as the ticket continues
 *   to be accepted, there is no need for credentials to be supplied again, and
 *   no authentication challenge.
 * - This continues until a site doesn't accept the stored ticket (e.g. the
 *   ticket has expired and cannot be renewed).
 * - The Kerberos realm must be accessible. One way is to configure the Kerberos
 *   realm as an Additional Server in the enterprise management console.
 * - Kerberos realms are treated differently to server addresses. An unqualified
 *   server address may be resolved according to configuration in the enterprise
 *   management console, but the short form of a Kerberos realm cannot be
 *   resolved in this way. Note that the short form of the Kerberos realm will
 *   typically be the form used when logging in to the enterprise LAN at the
 *   desktop. The long form is typically the short form with the domain
 *   appended.
 * - Kerberos delegation can be allowed or disallowed. See
 *   \link GDCacheController::kerberosAllowDelegation:
 *   GDCacheController::kerberosAllowDelegation:\endlink.
 * .
 * 

 * <h3>HTTP Cookie Handling</h3>
 * By default, HTTP cookies received through BlackBerry Dynamics secure
 * communication are handled automatically:
 * - Set-cookie: headers that are received as part of an HTTP response are
 *   processed and then added to subsequent matching requests.
 * - Persistent cookies are written to cookie storage in the BlackBerry Dynamics
 *   secure store.
 * .
 * 
 * The BlackBerry Dynamics cookie store persists between executions of the
 * application, and if the mobile device is switched off.
 * The contents of the store can be managed with the native
 * <tt>NSHTTPCookieStorage</tt> programming interface, and so can non-persistent
 * cookies received through BlackBerry Dynamics secure communication.
 *
 * Automatic handling of HTTP cookies received through BlackBerry Dynamics
 * secure communication can be switched off, as follows.
 * - For communication that goes via the <tt>GDURLLoad</tt><tt>ingSystem</tt>,
 *   such as <tt>NSURLSession</tt> and <tt>NSURLConnection</tt>, call the
 *   <tt>setHTTPShouldHandleCookies:</tt> method of the associated
 *   <tt>NSMutableURLRequest</tt> instance.
 * .
 * @see <a
 *     HREF="https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/nshttpcookiestorage"
 *     target="_blank"
 * >NSHttpCookieStorage class reference</a> on the apple.com developer website.

 * switched off then these will be switched back on when the first connection is
 * re-opened. (See also the <tt>disableHostVerification</tt>,

 *
 * This function should only be called if the following all apply.
 * - Some options were switched off when the request was sent.
 * - A new request will be sent to the same endpoint.
 * - For the new request, one or more of the options that were switched off are
 *   to be switched on.
 * .
 *
 * Connections may remain open after the HTTP transaction completes. Even if
 * another instance of GDHttpRequest is constructed, connections may still be
 * reused. Calling this function immediately after the transaction completes
 * will ensure that connections are closed, and any SSL/TLS verifications that
 * were switched off are switched back on.
 *
 * After calling this function, it may take longer to make another HTTP request
 * to the same host.
 *
 * This function can be called when the ready state is
 * <tt>GDHttpRequest_DONE</tt>. Compare \ref abort.
